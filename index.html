				<h1>Hello!</h1>
				<h2>Student of Computer Games Development at University of Limerick</h2>
				<p>Hi there! I'm Dylan King. I'm currently a 2nd year student of Computer Games Development, at University of Limerick. I've always had an interest in programming, having first started learning Javascript and Python at a young age, and formally beginning to learn once I entered university in 2017. I chose the Games Development course because I thought it allowed for more creative expression, and would lead to being a better disciplined programmer, with the need to manage computer resources for computer games.</p>

			<h1 style="color:azure">My Skills</h1>
			<div id="skills-container">
				<div class="box on-grey box-skill">
					<h2>Java</h2>
					<p>Java was my first language I learned in University. I have made several projects using the language, some of which you can see below. I like the language because it's very approachable for new programmers, and is great for learning Object-Oriented Design.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box on-grey box-skill">
					<h2>C/C++</h2>
					<p>I started learning C last year as part of an Operating Systems module I had. While it wasn't one of my favourite languages at first, I have grown to like it. It takes away a lot of the restrictions and safety measures of Java, and is grea for writing efficient programs.</p>
					<p>C++ brings all the performance advantages, and Object Oriented Design. I've only recently started C++, but I've made good progress with my work on my Zork project, which you can see below.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box on-grey box-skill">
					<h2>MySQL</h2>
					<p>I started MySQL last semester, as part of my Database Systems module. I made a sample database as part of a group project, for the multiplayer system of a First-Person-Shooter.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box on-grey box-skill">
					<h2>Teamwork</h2>
					<p>I have worked on several group projects during my time in university, both as part of my course-work, and as part of game jams.</p>
					<p>I believe game jams are great ways to improve your teamwork and communication skills, as they are short term projects, packed with content, and the need to both communicate and delegate. Some of my projects below are from Game Jams.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box on-grey box-skill">
					<h2>Social Media</h2>
					<p>As P.R.O. of the Games Development Society in UL, I've learned how to manage a Facebook page, and write expressive and clear emails, as part of the societies weekly news-letter.</p>

				<h1>Interests</h1>
				<p>I am passionate about programming, having started to learn Python and JavaScript when I was 13. I've always wanted to learn more, and went to my local CoderDojo for some time, where I also leaned HTML and CSS, which you can see now.</p>
				<p>I also have a deep interest in video games, having grown up with varios consoles. I was drawn to Games Development, and am now the Public Relations Officer of ULs Games Development Society, where I am responsible for the societies social media accounts, and the weekly email for members. The society also runs workshops for various technologies used in game development, such as Unity, and Krita for animation. We also host Game Jams every semester, open to members of the society. Below, you'll find my entries into them.</p>
